# ny07-webgame-project-triva


## Project Description

This will be a triva game with serveral topics to choose from. Brainteesers are always fun I've always found them interesting. They can also be be a wonderful learing tool.
## Game Logic

```
I will use a trivia API(https://the-trivia-api.com/api/questions) to pull in random triva questions to pose to users. 
Users will answer ten questions. If the user gets 5 or more questions correct, they will win. If the user gets less than 5 question correct, the game will be over and they will lose.
