## Project Description

This will be a triva game with serveral topics to choose from. Brainteesers are always fun I've always found them interesting. They can also be be a wonderful learing tool.
## Game Logic

```
I will use a trivia API(https://the-trivia-api.com/api/questions) to pose questions to a user
In this game, you only get once chance to get the correct answer.
If you are not confident in your answer, Do not answer the question.
Select 'Next Question' to move on to another quesion if you think you have no chance of getting the current question correct.
If you submit a wrong answer, the game over and you will lose.
If you submit a correct answer, you will win the game
